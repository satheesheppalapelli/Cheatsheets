**Cheatsheets**

Awesome cheatsheets for popular programming languages, frameworks and development tools. 
They include everything you should know in one single file.

**Why Cheatsheets?**
    
    I usually make a cheatsheet when I want to improve my skills on a programming language, 
    a framework or a development tool. I started doing these kind of things a long time ago 
    on Gist. To better keep track of the history and to let people contribute, I reorganized 
    all of them into this single repository. Most of the content is coming from official 
    documentations and some books I have read.
    
    Feel free to take a look. You might learn new things. They have been designed to provide 
    a quick way to assess your knowledge and to save you time.
